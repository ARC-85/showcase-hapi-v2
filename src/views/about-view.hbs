    <p>When a Project is added to a Portfolio, the location of the Project is displayed as a marker on a map, to demonstrate where a Vendor's work is concentrated.</p> <br>
    <p>Projects within a Portfolio are listed with brief details, however clicking into individual Projects allows display of detailed information, including a display of images related to the Project.</p>
